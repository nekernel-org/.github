## Roadmap

The stack is currently being upgraded to version **0.0.2**, with a focus on:
- A tighter, more refined architecture
- Expanded hardware support
- A next-generation filesystem (HeFS)

## Software Design

- Each **repository** was built with modularity at its core.  
- Each **component** — from **drivers** to **services** — is designed to be cleanly extensible.  
- New **tools**, **kits**, or **architectures** can be integrated without rewriting the core.
