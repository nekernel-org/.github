## What's the logo?

That's a Tanuki, known for their cleverness.

## What is NeKernel?

A full-systems research project, fully open-source and available under the GPL 3.0 license.

## What's the current roadmap?

We are currently working towards the v1.0.0, stay tuned for updates!

## Where do I connect with others?

We have a community discord, join us at https://discord.gg/uw3pQ7ysj8

## What's the philosophy?

We rely on those three guidelines:

- Each **repository** is built with modularity at its core.  
- Each **component** from **drivers** to **services** is designed to be cleanly extensible.  
- New **tools**, **kits**, or **architectures** can be integrated without rewriting the core.

## What about commercial licensing?

**NeKernel.org** has two radically different version of its repositories, **SNU** and the **NeKernel organization**. If you are interested in licensing **SNU** for commercial usage, please go to http://snu.systems.
