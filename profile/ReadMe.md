That's a Tanuki. Known for their cleverness. His name is Rodger.

## What is NeKernel.org?

A full-systems research project. Fully open-source and available under the GPL 3.0 license.

## What's the current roadmap?

We are currently working towards the v2.0.0. Stay tuned for updates!

(*v2.0.0 should hopefully include a port of the X11 window server and Wayland if needed.*)

## Where do I connect with others?

We have a community Discord. Join us at https://discord.gg/uw3pQ7ysj8

## What's the project philosophy?

We rely on those three guidelines:

- Each **Repository** must be built with modularity at its core.  
- Each **Components** from: **Drivers** to **Services** is to be designed as cleanly extensible.  
- New **Tools**, **Software Kits**, and **Software Architectures** are to be integrated without rewriting everything else.

## What about commercial licensing?

**NeKernel.org** has two radically different version of its repositories, **SNU** and the **NeKernel organization**. If you are interested in licensing **SNU** for commercial usage, please go to http://snupowered.com
