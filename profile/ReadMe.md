## What is NeKernel.org?

A fully open-source and advanced R&D project. Available under the GPL 3.0 license.

## What are the project guidelines?

We rely on those three guidelines:

- Each **Repository** must be built with modularity at its core.  
- Each **Components** from: **Drivers** to **Services** is to be designed as cleanly extensible.  
- New **Tools**, **Software Kits**, and **Software Architectures** are to be integrated without rewriting everything else.
